## Project Description 

Weeble is a web application that allows users to match and connect with individuals who share
similar interests and/or hobbies. This application will allow the user to create a profile in which
they can express their preferences, hobbies, and interests. It will then take these parameters into
consideration and find compatible matches that fit the user’s criteria. In comparison to other
dating websites in the market, the algorithm designed for this application will have a strong focus
on prioritizing the hobbies and interests of the user. This software is intended to help facilitate
individuals who are seeking intimate as well as platonic relationships.. 

## Stakeholders

**The following stakeholders have been identified:**

**Product manager/Architectural Engineer:**
The product manager/architectural engineer aims to guide our team of developers and design a
functional prototype within the given time constraint . The requirements from the product
manager are congruent with the demands from our shareholders. As such, the product
manager/architectural engineer aims to ensure that the needs of our shareholders are met.

**Software Developer:**
The software developer(s) aims to create a functional product following the guidelines and vision
set in place by the product manager. The goals and responsibilities of the software developers
depends on what aspect of the web application they will be working on. Front end developers
will prioritize ensuring that the web application is intuitive to use and easy to navigate. The
backend developer will ensure that functionality of the matchmaking algorithm as well as store
and secure the user’s personal information.

**Shareholders/Customers:**
The aims and goals of our project are derived from the expectations and requirements of the
shareholders/customers. The shareholder/customers needs and requirements are focused on being
able to have a high ROI (return of investment). Shareholders/customers have expressed wanting
to utilize a freemium business model (a business model which generates revenue on users who
pay for upgraded features).

**End user/clients:**
The requirements and needs of our end users/clients dictate the shape of our web application.
The end user/clients ultimately want to be able to successfully find and form relationships with
people who have similar interests/hobbies as themselves in an efficient and effortless manner.The end user/client satisfaction and expectations must be met for our application to be successful

## Product vision and Scope

The product vision of our web application is to facilitate creating long lasting and meaningful
relationships with others who share similar interests and hobbies. This would be accomplished
by creating an interface that allows users to express themselves and find others who share a
similar passion in life. An algorithm that is able to calculate how compatible individuals are and
show those who pass a specific threshold to the user would need to be implemented. Finally, a
messaging application would be needed to allow the user to communicate with their matches.

# Vision statement

Our vision is to provide a service where people can express and celebrate their hobbies with
other individuals who share similar passions. We want to be able to allow our users to create
meaningful bonds that will last a lifetime.
